When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    Allways. In some cases to collaborate with other, in all to have a backup of my files and commit history in case anything happens to my computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It is like working with branches. You want to merge both only when you know that it will work. This way you also control the files in your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    Forks only happen in GitHub. You use them to get the files of a project and work on them on your side. Clones are copies of your github repository on your local machine, or copies of your own repo in your own machine. A branch is a separate line of changes made to a program while the parent may keep on changing without affecting each other until a merge is done.
    Fork to get the code from interesting projects in github to be able to play with it and maybe even make contributions.
    Clone to have the repository in your machine.
    Branch to change the context of your development, experimenting with new features or adding new functionalities without breaking the master code (production).

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Caching your GitHub password in Git: https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/

Cannot clone my repository directly to github. I have to create an empty remote repository first.

no staging area with remote.

Create

  git remote add origin https://github.com/ramonsuarez/reflections.git

Clone existing files into my local repo .
  git clone github_repo_url

Push my files to github:
  ramon (master) reflections $ git remote -v
  origin  https://github.com/ramonsuarez/reflections.git (fetch)
  origin  https://github.com/ramonsuarez/reflections.git (push)
  ramon (master) reflections $ git push origin master
  Username for 'https://github.com': XXX
  Password for 'XXX':

Pulling master updates files from github in my local repository
  git pull origin master
  git push origin master
Fork is clone that github makes for you in your repository.

When you clone a github repo github automatically sets up a remote pointing to the repo you cloned from.

You can add colaborators in your github repos directly in github with their github user name.
